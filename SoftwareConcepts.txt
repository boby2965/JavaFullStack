--------------- SOFTWARE CONCEPTS ------------------

Software : 
  --> A series of commands that tells the computer to do a particular task
  --> software consists of multiple commands comming together to execute a task.
  ex: MSOffice, Tally tcc ,.
  
Software can be divided into three categories
  - system software 
  - utility software
  - application software

System software: 
  --> system software is a software that controls the hardware parts of the computer and interacts with the application software. 
  --> The system softwre is dependant on the system hardware and hence cannot be transferred from one machine to another. 
  --> It is of three types 
      1) Operating systems
      2) Language processor 
            Assembler -- Translates the assembly language to machine language program
            Interpeter -- Translates high level language to machine level language line by line. 
            Compiler -- Translates high level language to machine level lanhhuage at one go.
      3) Device Drivers
            It is the software that instructs, monitors and controls the functioning of a specific device on the computer.  
 
 Operating Systems:
   --> An operating system is a type of system sofware which acts as a communication bridge between the computer hardware and the 
   end-user.
   -->It manages the computer momery and tasks running on it. 
   --> it is the first software thet is loaded in the computer memory when booted. 
   --> Responsible for resourse management, conflict resolution and operation control.
   ex: linux, Windows etc,.
  
  Functions of operating system:
       1) Memory Management
       2) File Management
       3) Security and protection
       4) Process management
       5) User Interface
       6) Device management
       
  Types of operating systems:
      1) GUI OS
            -- Modern operating systems use a graphic user interface or GUI
            -- Using the combination graphic and text, every thing is displayed clearly on the screen 
      2) Time-sharing OS
            -- Time sharing or multi tasking OS enables people located at different terminals or shells to work at the same time on 
            a single computer.
      3) Real Time OS
            -- In this the time to process the inout and give out the response is very small. These are generally used in Military 
            and space software systems.
      4) Distributed OS
            -- It uses many processors located in different locations to provide faster responses or results to users.
      5) Network OS
            -- It serves to manage data, Users, Groups, security, appliations and other networking functions 
      6) Batch OS
            -- To reduce the processing time and increse the effeciency, jobs with similar needs are batched together and processed.
      7) Mobile OS
            -- OS which is specially designed to power tablets, smartphones and werable devices
